3 Pros and Cons Functional vs Object Oriented Programming
Functional is great for data Service
Functional is easier to understand
functional does not require the same thing to be written over again and again.
Functions can be invoked realitively easily 
functions can be reused 
functions are first class citizens
Object Oriented has objects that can be reused in other applications
objects are easily to be created
functional emphasizes evaluation of functions      Object oriented is based on objects
F uses immutable data OO uses mutable(variables can be changed) data
F declarative programming model (instructing a program what needs to be done instead of telling it how to do it) OO imperative programming model(telling it how you want it done)
f supports parallel programming oo no pararllel programming supports
f statements can be executed in any order  oo statements should be executed in particular order
f recursion for iterative data  OO loops for iterative data
f basic elements are variables and functions OO basic elements are objects and methods
F used when there are a few things with more operations  OO used when there are many things with few operations
